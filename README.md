# LinkedIn-Filter-and-Sort
Chrome extension for adding filtering &amp; sorting to LinkedIn's 'People you may know'

## Features
* Load 100+ profiles by clicking a button
* Filter results by keyword (name & job title)
* Sort by number of shared connections

### Shortcomings
* Due to linkedin's infinite scroll, "sort by connections" won't sort new results introduced by scrolling. Filtering by keyword will work when new results are injected when scrolling, however this is a bit buggy. Both examples are the reasoning behind forcing load of 100 profiles before filtering or sorting.
